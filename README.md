# promptingFridgeMagnet
A Simple device that can give a random prompt everyday on your fridge if you are an artist.

This is probably my first Arduino project and I wanted to start with something really small and simple using the [[Arduino Nano]].

I wanted to start practicing more art this summer and I've always loved r/sketchdaily on reddit but have been wanting to avoid reddit a bit more cause I always tend to get carried away with other posts I find there.

I decided to make my own device that I could put a bunch of random prompts into to help me be able to have a good random Art prompt first thing in the morning when I'm getting food or water from my fridge.

This doesn't have to be a prompt for art only, It could be a prompt for a creative electronics project to try everyday, a short story or just words of encouragement.
